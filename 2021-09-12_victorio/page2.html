    <h1>Victorio's Commands and Schedule: How to take care of him</h1>
    <p>Since Vincent and Victorio were both born in Buenos Aires, Argentina they both understand Spanish. Spanish was Vincent’s first language. This means that whenever Vincent talks to Victorio or gives him commands they are in Spanish – this has been fun for Vincent’s roommates to learn while he’s gone. 
    <br>Here is a few examples of the commands:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>"A comer"</dt>
        <dd>Command meaning: "time to eat"</dd>
        <dt>"A pasear"</dt>
        <dd>Command meaning: "time to walk"</dd>
        <dt>"Que paso?"</dt>
        <dd>Used as a term to get his attention when playing or when something new occured; means "what happened?"</dd>
        <dt>"Vamos"</dt>
        <dd>Used most when walking from one area to another; means "let's go"</dd>
        <dt>"A dormir"</dt>
        <dd>Command meaning: "time to sleep"</dd>
        <dt>"Muy bien!"</dt>
        <dd>Command meaning: "good job!"</dd>
    </dl>
